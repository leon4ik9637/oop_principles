        WHAT IS ABSTRACTION?
        - Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and
        showing only functionality to the user
        - Abstraction only deals with WHAT TO DO
        - HOW TO DO is the concern of subclasses that extends to abstract
        class

        HOW TO ACHIEVE ABSTRACTION IN JAVA?
        1. Abstract classes
        2. Interfaces

        1. ABSTRACT CLASSES
        - We can create abstract classes with the "abstract" keyword
        - we can create abstract methods in the abstract classes (also
        interfaces)
        - the aim of having an abstract class is to create som abstract
        methods that will guide child classes what to do

        ABSTRACT METHODS: these are the methods that have no body

        RULES:
        - abstract class cannot be instantiated
        - abstract classes can have constructors and the aim is to use them
        in the child classes
        - abstract class cannot be final, static, private, or protected
        - abstract methods cannot be private, static or final
        - once a child class extends to abstract class, the first thing to do
        is providing the method implementations
        - we can have both abstract and non-abstract method in the abstract
        class
